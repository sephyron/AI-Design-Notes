| Checklist Item                    | Description                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clear Role Definition**         | Clearly communicate the roles and responsibilities of both the AI System and human in order to set expectations and avoid confusion.     |
| **Set Boundaries**                | Establish ethical guidelines, policies and other boundaries that the AI System and human must adhere to.                            |
| **Real-time Collaboration**       | Enable real-time communication and collaboration between human users and the AI system to facilitate efficient teamwork.           |
| **Contextual Assistance**         | Provide suggestions, recommendations, or insights that are relevant to the user's current task or context with or without AI.      |
| **Explainable AI**                | Present the reasoning behind AI-generated decisions or recommendations in an easily understandable manner.                        |
| **Feedback and Confirmation**     | Offer users clear feedback on their actions and confirmation patterns for critical tasks for added friction. |
